- Log In 
- Save Letters
They are not editable or you cannot delete a letter. It is what makes it something good. 
- No Messaging System
  
Actually, I am one of the most sociable people I know. I used to be a board member of nearly 20 clubs at Bilkent. Also, I do extracurricular activites nearly every day of the week. Yet, I cannot believe that I am the only person struggling with loneliness. I found out that, I was really idealistic about many things. People think they have friends because they have someone messaging them. 

Actually, I don't use my phone when it is not necessary. I HATE messaging with someone I love, chit-chatting nonsense. I believe soul-to-soul connections. There are no barriers for real connections. Messaging is an illusion, it cannot be replaced with anything REAL.

- Make a QR code to give all your letters when it is okay.
  
There was someone I loved once. I wrote hundreds of letters to him, but I throw them all away or deleted them. Maybe, there will be no chance to tell him how much I loved him once but still I wish I could find my letters. (Oh, what if someone another reads them?) I wish I could find them and see how much love I felt for him once. How pure my heart once was.
* Oh, there will be no screen shots. Thare are lots of jerks who won't hesitate to laugh at your cries. Privacy is important.

Also, it is an app to leave the notes app in peace!! Hahhahaahaha :D
